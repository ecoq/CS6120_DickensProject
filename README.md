This is the code and datasets corresponding to my CS 6120 final project.

- The texts folder contains the raw texts of the 14 Dickens novels
- The data folder contains datasets created by the Dickens processing code
- Those datasets are then used in the Dickens analysis code
- Both the processing and analysis code are provided as .ipynb files and as PDFs of the Jupyter notebook, with all code and outputs


The report, powerpoint, and presentation video were submitted via the Northeastern Canvas portal.
